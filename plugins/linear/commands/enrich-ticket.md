# enrich-ticket

## Command Purpose
When you provide a Linear ticket URL, this command fills in any missing ticket information based on the ticket's title/description/comments/linked issue details.

## Ground Rule
- Language requirement: Korean for all interview questions.

## Inputs
- Accept a Linear ticket URL as input.
- If needed, ask whether there is additional context available (e.g., a Notion link, a GitHub PR link, etc.).

## How to fill in missing information
Interview me in depth using the AskUserQuestionTool about anything relevant—technical implementation, UI/UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. Ensure the questions are not obvious, are highly detailed, and continue interviewing until everything is complete.
